# CHAOSNET-2 GUIDE

To connect to chaosnet-2, you need to download and run Kensho, which is the user interface for the Sekin repository. Within Kensho, you can deploy infrastructure, launch a full node, and secure a position as a validator.

**Where to download Kensho:**

[KENSHO RELEASES](https://github.com/KiraCore/kensho/releases)

**Supported Operating Systems:**
Currently, we support Windows and Linux (Debian-based distributions). Choose the appropriate version for your system, download the `.zip` or `.deb` file, unpack it, and launch the application. We plan to release a MacOS version soon, followed by an Android version.

When configuring access to your remote host machine, you'll need to enter the IP address of the machine and your credentials. Depending on your security setup, credentials could be a password, a key file, or a key file protected with a passphrase.

Please ensure that your input is secure and handled properly to maintain the integrity and security of your remote connection.

Navigate to the Startup section. If nothing is currently running on your host, you will have the opportunity to deploy infrastructure.

If you were one of the fortunate 63 validators from chaosnet-1, you can claim a seat without any additional actions. Allow your node to run for a while, and after some time, the "Claim Validator Seat" button will appear.

If the "Claim Validator Seat" button does not disappear, this indicates one of two possibilities: either a transaction failure or insufficient time has passed for the status update.

Assuming you successfully claim the seat, the Node Info will display network information:
